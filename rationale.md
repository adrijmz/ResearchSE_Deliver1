## Rationale

The provided code accomplishes various tasks related to the extraction and analysis of information from 10 selected articles located in the directory /papers in PDF format.

### Extraction of PDF Text with Grobid:
The extract_text_with_grobid(pdf_path) function is used to extract text from PDF documents. Grobid is a tool for processing scientific documents that can extract metadata and full text from PDF documents.
### Generation of Keyword Cloud:
The generate_keyword_cloud(abstracts) function takes the list of articles and creates a keyword cloud. This provides a quick visualization of the most frequent words in the abstracts, which can help identify main topics or common areas of focus among the articles.
### Counting Figures per Article:
The count_figures(articles) function counts the number of figures in each article. This can be useful for understanding the amount of visual content in each article, which could indicate the level of complexity or the importance of visualization in the presented research.
### Extraction of Article Links:
The extract_links(article_url) function attempts to extract links within the PDF documents, specifically the references cited in the articles. These references can provide additional information or relevant resources for the research.
