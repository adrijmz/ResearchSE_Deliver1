It provides a suite of features to facilitate the analysis of multiple articles, including text extraction, keyword cloud generation, and figure counting.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Text Extraction: \r\nUtilizes Grobid to extract text from PDF documents, enabling further analysis of the content.\r\n### Keyword Cloud Generation: \r\nCreates a keyword cloud based on the abstracts of the articles, providing a visual representation of the most common words.\r\n### Figure Counting: \r\nCounts the number of figures in each article, aiding in understanding the visual content of the research presented.\r\n### Link Extraction (WIP): \r\nInitial implementation for extracting links within the PDF documents, particularly references cited in the articles. Please note that this feature is still a work in progress and may not function correctly.",
